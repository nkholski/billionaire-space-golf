# Billionaire Space Golf

Play here: https://js13kgames.com/entries/billionaire-space-golf 

Ordinary leisure trips beyond Kármán line just isn't enough for the buckazoid billionaires of 20xx. In the pursuit of new endeavors, Space Golf was invited.
Get ready to conquer a fresh nine world course. Why not eighteen worlds you say? Because that would require buckazoid trillionaires, and that's just silly.

This was made by Nelson Berg (8 years), Mio Berg (5 years) and their much older father Niklas Berg.

How to play
* The game is best played with keyboard. Use arrow keys to aim and set power and space to shoot. All menus are navigable with the keyboard.
* You can also use the mouse or touch. Drag inside the square to aim and set power. Tap or click to shoot.
* Earth-like planets are bouncy, sandy planets are sandy, red planets are deadly, white planets has negative gravity.
* Your best games are saved, and you can share their urls to others.

# THIS REPO IS A MESS
Everything is as it was when I finished. The last few days consisted entirely of quick hacks and bad practices. The result is something that will need a couple of days of refactoring and fixing before it could be developed further.
There are many optimisation possibilities. Right now I redraw a lot of stuff that could be stored on offline canvases, but it wasn't time nor bytes to fix. Speaking of bytes. There are a ton to do to make it smaller but since I was
under 13kb I didn't.
